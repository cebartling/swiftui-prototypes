            "Terrific overall athlete. Looked like a tight end when he scored a TD against WVU in 2019.",
            "Can sink low and drive when he wants to at 6-foot-7. Six big-time blocks this past season.",
            "Great at opening hips and riding rushers past the top of the pocket.",

            "Shuffle out in pass protection leaves him off balance and unable to adjust quickly.",

            "Late out of his stance a noticeable number of times on tape.",
            "Tendency to play high in pass protection. Leaves himself very susceptible to bull rush."
